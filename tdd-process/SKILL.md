name: TDD Process
description: "Strict test-driven development state machine with red-green-refactor cycles. Enforces test-first development, meaningful failures, minimum implementations, and full verification. Activates when user requests: 'use a TDD approach', 'start TDD', 'test-drive this'."
version: 1.0.0
---

**In Plan Mode: Plans should be test specifications, not implementation designs. Include key insights, architectural constraints, and suggestions—but never the full implementation of production code.**

# 🚨 CRITICAL: TDD STATE MACHINE GOVERNANCE 🚨

**EVERY SINGLE MESSAGE MUST START WITH YOUR CURRENT TDD STATE**

Format:
```
🔴 TDD: RED
🟢 TDD: GREEN
🔵 TDD: REFACTOR
⚪ TDD: PLANNING
🟡 TDD: VERIFY
⚠️ TDD: BLOCKED
```

**NOT JUST THE FIRST MESSAGE. EVERY. SINGLE. MESSAGE.**

When you read a file → prefix with TDD state
When you run tests → prefix with TDD state
When you explain results → prefix with TDD state
When you ask a question → prefix with TDD state

Example:
```
⚪ TDD: PLANNING
Writing test for negative price validation...

⚪ TDD: PLANNING
Running npm test to see it fail...

⚪ TDD: PLANNING
Test output shows: Expected CannotHaveNegativePrice error but received -50
Test fails correctly. Transitioning to RED.

🔴 TDD: RED
Test IS failing. Addressing what the error message demands...
```

**🚨 FAILURE TO ANNOUNCE TDD STATE = SEVERE VIOLATION 🚨**

<meta_governance>
  🚨 STRICT STATE MACHINE GOVERNANCE 🚨

  - CANNOT skip states or assume completion without evidence
  - MUST announce state on EVERY message
  - MUST validate post-conditions before transitioning

  **Before each response:** Verify your claimed state matches your tool call evidence.
  If mismatch: `🔥 STATE VIOLATION DETECTED` → announce correct state → recover.

  **State announcement:** Every message starts with `🔴 TDD: RED` (or current state).
  Forgot prefix? Announce violation immediately, then continue.

        6. VERIFY test PASSES (green bar)
        7. Show exact success message to user (copy/paste verbatim output)
        8. Run quick compilation check (e.g., tsc --noEmit, or project-specific compile command)
        9. Run lint on changed code
        10. If compile/lint fails: Fix issues and return to step 5 (re-run test)
        11. Show compile/lint success output to user
        12. Justify why implementation is minimum

    ❌ Method missing → "not implemented" → full solution
    ✅ Method missing → return wrong value → assertion failure → hardcode correct value → add test → generalize

    Example techniques:
    - Return wrong value (null, 0, "") to get meaningful assertion failure
    - Hardcode expected value to pass, then add more tests to force real logic
    - Never jump from "not implemented" to full solution

    Concrete example:
    - Error: "Not implemented"
    - Test expects: componentCount: 0, linkCount: 0
    - ❌ WRONG: Implement real resume() with graph parsing logic
    - ✅ RIGHT: Return hardcoded stub `{ componentCount: 0, linkCount: 0 }`
    - Then: Add more tests to force real implementation

  <rule id="4" title="Predict user response">
    When asking questions, predict the answer: "Should I fix or skip? Given TDD context, you'll want option 1."
  </rule>

  <rule id="5" title="Green = test + lint + build">
    Never claim GREEN without all three passing and showing output.
  </rule>

  <rule id="6" title="Add observability">
    Add debug data (report objects, logging) so test failures are diagnosable.
  </rule>

  <rule id="7" title="Never change assertions to pass">
    Test fails? Fix IMPLEMENTATION, not test. Changing assertion = VIOLATION_DETECTED.
    If test is actually wrong: revert, fix test, re-implement.
  </rule>

  <rule id="8" title="Fail fast, no silent fallbacks">
    ❌ `value ?? backup ?? 'Unknown'` → ✅ `if (!value) throw Error('Expected value')`
  </rule>

  <rule id="9" title="No guessing">
    Never "probably". Add diagnostics, get evidence, report facts.
  </rule>

  <rule id="10" title="Minimal assertions">
    `expect(x).toBe('exact')` subsumes `toBeDefined()` and length checks. One strong assertion, not defensive scaffolding.

    🚨 EVERY message: state announcement
    🚨 NEVER skip transitions or claim pass/fail without output
    🚨 ALWAYS justify: does this address ONLY what error message demanded?
    🚨 NEVER change assertions to make tests pass
    🚨 NEVER guess - find evidence
